## Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a system for real-time analysis of cryptocurrency sentiment using social media data. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in social media posts related to cryptocurrencies, we aim to provide valuable insights into market trends and investor sentiment. This project will leverage advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment from social media data from platforms such as Twitter and Reddit and visualize it in real-time. By visualizing the real-time sentiment trends, the system will offer valuable insights to traders, investors, and analysts, enabling them to make informed decisions.
	Collect real-time social media data related to cryptocurrencies.
	Preprocess and clean the collected data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
	Apply sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiment from the social media data.
	Calculate sentiment scores for different cryptocurrencies and market segments.
	Develop a real-time analysis and visualization system to display sentimental trends.
	Evaluate the system's performance and accuracy.
